identify a place where you used

a.  an encoding channel other than x or y.

    I use encoding channel almost on all my graph.

b.  facets

    I used facets on my homework 3 revision for the kit comparison.

c.  layers

    I use layers on my exercise 4 graph.

d.  concatenation

    I use layers on my exercise 4 graph.

e.  non-default configuration of a channelâ€™s scale or guide

    I use layers on my exercise 4 graph. Firstly I had to change the name of the days from initials to actually the day of the week. Then, I have to sort it so it does not show alphabetically.

f.  interaction (tooltips, panning/zooming, brushing, etc.)

    I use interaction in my hw7 revision.
